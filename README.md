Summary: This is a example how to setup wiringpi in c++ and Cmake
for Raspberry Pi gpio programming using vscode .


WARNING!: the instructions are explained in text ,This is example is Made with the best of my
limited skills if there is something wrong please comment Maybe i can help what went wrong.
 Links for setting Required tools or software are in the video description(if there is space for it) or github repository, you need access to setup before hand the gpio access(link is in the video description  or github repository)

Recommended skills:
 programming in c++ and cmake,using terminal commands in debian or ubuntu linux,  
 ssh into a Raspberr Pi , experience in gpio programming is Recommended.

GPIO SETUP:
gpio pin(bcm NUMBERING pin to your choosing) to> positive leg  of the 
led in the
breadbord.
gnd pin to> negative  leg of the led with a resistor (220 ohm is reasonable
).

Required vscode extension:
c/c++(or c/c++ extension pack) ,remote devolopment,cmake tools(or c/c++ extension pack) .


 Required software setup for the Raspberry Pi :
 vscode, latest ubuntu server lts/ Raspbery pi os image on the Raspberry Pi,
 Cmake, gcc for linux , gdb.

 Required tools:
 wifi.
1x laptop/pc(to ssh into the Raspberry Pi)
1x raspberry pi 5/4/ZW2 board with a debian or ubuntu server lts  64bit image setup.

1x blinking led.

2x m/f jumper wire.

minimal of 1 m/m wire.
1x breadbord.

if you like my videos i post my c/c++ 1 week earlier at the moment at corder.tv(recommended for for 13 or older ): https://corder.tv/channel/Dawsabot22.



If thats all nog een fijne dag.
